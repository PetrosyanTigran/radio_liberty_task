#Test - Frontend

#### The assignment

   * Create a static HTML page
   * Place an element list (UL) in that
   * Load your page with URL containing #tags=red,blue,purple at the end
   * Write a Javascript that displays the tags from the URL in the list, where each tag is displayed as a separate list item
   * for example, if you have #tags=red,blue,purple in the URL, the list will be displayed with 3 items
   * Write a Javascript, that will update the tag list every time the URL hash is changed
   * Create your own well-structured CSS (Sass / LESS / Stylus...) styles

#### Additional exercises (optional)

1.  Adding and removing tags

    * Add an text input and a button to the page
    * Once the button is clicked the text of the input element is added as a new tag into the URL hash (#tags=red,blue,purple,mytag)
    * By clicking on an item in the list the item will be removed from the list and from the URL

2. Wrap the code

    * Encapsulate the code as a visual component ( using React .js / any other alternative javascript framework you prefer such as Vue.js ... )
    * Place the component on the page three times
   
3. Visual appearance

    * Use some existing style library (material, bootstrap ...)
